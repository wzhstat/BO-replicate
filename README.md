# closed-loop-replicate
# Python Version
python 3.7.7
# Install Requirements
To run the reaction condition selector you need to make sure you have installed anaconda. ```conda_env.yml``` is needed to recreate the environment.
# Hierarchical clustering
In order to obtain the initial reaction substrate, the following steps were adopted:<br>
1. Assembled about 5,400 purchasable aryl halides from the inventory of common chemical suppliers through data mining.<br>
2. Using a hierarchical clustering strategy, the building blocks in these chemical Spaces were grouped according to their common aromatic ring substructures and hanging functions, and 54 of the most representative molecules were selected.<br>
